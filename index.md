txxt is a brain dead plain text format born out of syntax and linting fatigue.  
markdown is as good as you'll get for generating HTML in a sane syntax.

if you don't want to generate HTML, plain text will get you very far, with less
fuss.

txt is about:

- simplicity, not much to learn tool-less: design to be authored and viewed with
- nothing but a text editor. structured: while simple and unobtrusive, txxt is
- meant for technical writing and can provide structure for technical writing.

It borrows heavily from the old usenet and early internet text communities,
being mostly a mix and match remix of many of it's patterns.
